# Games Calendar

A very simple calendar that allows users to check when upcoming games are releasing. When a day has multiple releases, the games are presented in a slideshow format. The slideshow may present some issues from time to time with its slides interval. <br/>

When clicking on any given game title, the user will be redirected to a new page providing some more in depth details about said game.

### These details are:
 - Release date
 - Platforms available on
 - Developers
 - Publishers
 - Link to the official website
 - Link to the official subreddit
 - Description
 - Trailer
 - Link to the official stores
 
If some of these details aren't available then that particular thing won't be shown or it will show up as 'Not Available'

Data is acquired by using the rawg.io API.
